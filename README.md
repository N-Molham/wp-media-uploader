# WordPress Media Uploader

A way to reuse media uploader in wordpress 3.5 and greater which is very very helpful and faster from the old one with backward compatibility.

## Usage ##
* just place the folder in you theme or plugin and include `/wp-media-uploader/media.php` file in you code
* call `nab_media_uploader_input()` and pass it's params and enjoy

the code is highly customizable through filters, I will list them with docs as soon as possible but they are fairly easy to understand.

**Please not: it is still work in progress but you can start working with it.**

Hope you find it helpful :)
